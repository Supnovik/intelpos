                <p>
                    This method is based on mental-spatial associations, the purpose of which is to create, organize and
                    further use the entire contents of memory; for a more creative approach. On the service, this method
                    will be implemented as attaching stickers, for example, to a photo of the user's workplace with the
                    information that he needs to remember.
